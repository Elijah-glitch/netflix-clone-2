# Project: Netflix Clone

## Date: 5 - Oct - 2020

### Functions

- This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I build this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling we implement. You will need knowledge of React (useEffect, useState, useContext) and you will need JavaScript knowledge for using higher order functions such as map, filter, reduce, and find. We will use Fuse.js for live search, and we will test all our components using React Testing Library. And of course we will use React router for navigation!
