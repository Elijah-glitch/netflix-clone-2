# Project: Netflix Clone

## Date: 5 - Oct - 2020

### Functions

- This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up.
- The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database.
- I build this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling we implement.
- I use Fuse.js for live search.
- and Im test all our components using React Testing Library.
- And of course we will use React router for navigation!
